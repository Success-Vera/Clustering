# Clustering

In this project, we carry out an unsupervised learning to ascertain the number of classses in the datasets provided. We implement KMeans clustering, Agglomerative clustering and Hierarchical clustering and compare the results.

After exploring the data, the following are the results obtained:
1. It was necessary to carry out PCA first before any attempt at clustering

2. The optimal clustering for each dataset differs.

3. After concating all the dataset, the wards method was able to give a reasonable amount of between inertia
